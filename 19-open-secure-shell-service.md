<h1> Chapter OpenSSH </h1>


this chapter takes into hand the following:
- installing openssh service
- configuring the service 
- establishing openssh key-based authentication


**most of these objectives can be learnt from an article or any youtube video. I'll not waste time on explaining them**
**once again and re-inventing the wheel**
